## Munro Lab Particle Tracking
The particle tracking algorithm that we use is μTrack, which was developed by the Danuser Lab (citation). Ed has made a MATLAB app/GUI for μTrack that we use for tracking and basic analysis and plots.  

This repo contains this MATLAB app and scripts that I have written for further analysis.
